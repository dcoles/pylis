Introduction
============
This is a small Python library for interacting with the L.I.S. MCE LCD display
manufactured by VLSystem <http://www.vlsys.co.kr/>.

While the device appears as a USB Serial Device, unfortunately there's no
official documentation on the protocol it uses. Thus the protocol has been mostly
deciphered by looking at how the official application does it.

Included are a few useful tools for interacting with the display.


Dependencies
============
- pyserial
